            <h3>The Sikora Group EXP Realty Hoboken, NJ</h3>
            <p>From May to August 2019, I worked as an intern for the Sikora Group in Hoboken, NJ. The Sikora Group is a realty group which focuses on creating revenue through the process of buying/selling residential and commercial properties throughout North Jersey. During my internship, I was responsible for generating new clients looking to sell their residential properties. I did this by making more than seven hundred cold call dials per day and researching recently expired home listings on various website platforms. I worked directly with lead real estate listing agent, Dan Spitz, who regularly met with clients, negotiated listing prices and who closed personal deals. The broker of the group, Brett Sikora, oversaw all the teams deals, set goals for the company, and aided any agent in need. Other key team members included the lead buying agent, Eric Eckhardt, and Human Resource manager Jason who arranged team meetings and represented the company externally.</p>

            <h3>BluShark Digital LLC Bethesda, MD</h3>
            <p>During the summer of 2018 I worked as a fellow intern for BluShark Digital, a search engine optimization startup with over 60 clients. The companys clients primarily consist of law firms and their main goal is to optimize their clients webpage ranking on Google so that when a user searches for a lawyer, their page comes up first. I was one of six interns who helped create content displayed on clients webpages and progress reports. I generated content through hour long interviews with lawyers which provided raw information for the content team to turn into webpage material. Additionally, I created monthly reports showing search result progress and how exactly the company was able to improve ranking. The company consisted of a content team, a webpage team who were responsible for building the hardware for sites, the interns, and the companys CEO who oversaw all operations.</p>
